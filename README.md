# Edit .env with your configurations
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploying to Render

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Create a new Web Service on [Render](https://render.com)
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the following settings:
   - **Environment**: Python
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py app:app`

### Environment Variables

Make sure to set these environment variables in your Render dashboard:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini API key |
| `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` | A secure random string for Flask sessions |
| `FLASK_ENV` | Set to `production` for deployment |

### Deployment Checks

- Ensure all requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`
- Check that `gunicorn_config.py` is properly configured
- Verify that `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
- Test the application locally before deploying

## 🌟 Features in Detail

### 1. Conversation Intelligence
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies communication styles
- **Intent Detection**: Understands user needs
- **Emotional Analysis**: Processes emotional context
- **Response Adaptation**: Tailors responses to user state

### 2. User Experience
- **Natural Flow**: Human-like conversation patterns
- **Emotional Support**: Empathetic response system
- **Contextual Memory**: Remembers conversation context
- **Adaptive Responses**: Matches user's communication style

### 3. Technical Innovation
- **Lightweight Processing**: Minimal resource usage
- **Efficient Caching**: Smart memory management
- **Quick Response**: Near-instant interactions
- **Scalable Design**: Handles multiple sessions efficiently

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Session Security**: Encrypted session management
- **Data Privacy**: No permanent storage of conversations
- **Access Control**: Secure authentication system
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse

## ⚠️ Usage Limits

### Gemini API Rate Limits
- The free tier of Gemini API has rate limits
- If you encounter "rate limit exceeded" error, wait for about an hour
- Consider implementing rate limiting in your application
- For production use, consider upgrading to a paid tier

### Render Free Tier
- Instances spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Included ping service helps keep the instance active
- First request after inactivity may take 50+ seconds
- For better performance, consider upgrading to a paid tier

## 🔄 Keeping the Service Active

### Ping Service
The project includes a ping service (`ping.py`) that helps prevent the Render instance from spinning down:
- Sends periodic requests every 14 minutes
- Runs as a separate worker service on Render
- Configured automatically through `render.yaml`
- Helps maintain faster response times

### Environment Variables for Ping Service
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `APP_URL` | Your Render application URL |

## 🤝 Best Practices for Interaction

1. **Be Open**: Share your thoughts naturally
2. **Take Time**: No rush in responses
3. **Be Honest**: Express genuine feelings
4. **Explore**: Engage in meaningful dialogue
5. **Trust**: Build a connection with Nirya
